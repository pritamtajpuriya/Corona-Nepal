    "question_1": "Is Ibuprofen dangerous in case of infection with corona virus ?",
    "answer_1": "There are currently no clear indications that this type of medication aggravates the severity of the disease. Observations have been made in individual cases, but this is not sufficient to prove that the medication played a causal role in the severity of the illness. Verification are ongoing. In the meantime, caution is recommended when taking Ibuprofen-based medicinal products. It is not generally necessary to treat a high temperature.\n\nIf you have a high temperature and find it is adversely affecting you, it is preferable to take a Paracetamol-based medicinal product (a list of medicinal products can be found below). Anyone following a long-term course of treatment using Ibuprofen-based medicinal products not related to COVID-19 should continue that treatment, but consult a doctor in the event of symptoms of an acute respiratory infection (cough, high temperature).",

    "question_2": "Can COVID-19 be treated with antibiotics ?",

    "answer_2":"No. Antibiotics only work for bacteria, not viruses. For this reason it is not possible to cure the new corona virus disease with antibiotics.",
    "question_3":"How dangerous is the disease?",
         "answer_3":"\n\nThe mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those whoâ€™ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk.\n",

         "question_4":"Where did the virus come from?",
         "answer_4":"\nThe virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The corona virus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.\n\n",
         "question_5":"How contagious is Covid-19?\n",
         "answer_5":"\nCovid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.\n\n",
         "question_6":"What is the mobile number of the contact person for this test?",
         "answer_6":"1.Dr. Shravan Kumar Misra\n2. Dr. Ranjit Shah\n3. Shri Rajesh Kumar Gupta \n4. Dinesh Thapa Magar (For Night Time)\n5. Naresh Thapa Magar  (for night time)",
         "question_7":"Which samples are collected for the Corona virus Test?",
         "answer_7":"Throat swab, Nasal swab etc. sample is collected for this test.",
         "question_8":"What is Community spread?",
         "answer_8":"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
